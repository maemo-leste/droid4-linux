This is a PVR/SGX driver derived from
a) TI Graphics_SDK_5_01_01_02 providing 1.10.2359475 for OMAP3 framebuffer
b) omap5-sgx-ddk-linux providing IMG DDK 1.14 ED3699939 for ARM, MIPS and i86 for DRM

Diffs to Original
=================
* includes internal API fixes for kernels up to v5.3
* lives in drivers/staging/pvr/1.14.3699939 - so that we can ask for inclusion in linux-next
* has Kconfig and Makefiles for in-kernel configuration (no separate build system)
* builds separate kernel modules for omap3430, omap3630, am335x, omap4, omap5, dra7 etc.
  pvrsrvkm -> e.g. pvrsrvkm_omap_omap5_sgx544_116
* the correct kernel module is automatically probed by matching .compatible in device tree
  so that the code is multi-platform friendly and /lib/modules can contain all variations
* code base should also support JZ4780/CI20 and some Intel Atom processors (CedarView, Poulsbo)

Status
======
* builds separate kernel modules
* works on Pyra/OMAP5 (if TILER framebuffer rotation and X11 are disabled)

ToDo
====
* replace static #ifdef of errata handlers by dynamic code (checking for e.g. compatible="sgx530-121")
  => this should make the code more independent of build-time flags e.g. -DSGX530 or -DREV=125
* read device tree properties e.g. for timers/pwm, memory etc.
  => this allows to remove SoC/ARCH dependent constants from code
* add new device tree node/properties for SGX features like number of cores (SGX_FEATURE_MP_CORE_COUNT)
  => this allows to reduce compile-time flags and better describes the hardware features
* remove SoC and ARCH dependencies and collapse eurasia_km/services4/system into a generic backend
  controlled by CONFIGs and device tree
  => this should make the same source compile for TI, Ingenic, others into a single kernel module
* remove all #if (LINUX_VERSION_CODE >= KERNEL_VERSION(...)) dependencies
  => we finally only need to handle current linus/master since we want to become part of it
* make Makefile recompile only what is needed
  => currently, the SGX driver is rebuilt every time

Configure
=========

User-Space
==========
downloads: to be defined

# modprobe pvrsrvkm_omap_omap5_sgx544_116 - unless loaded through device tree
pvrsrvctl --start --no-module
cat /proc/pvr/*	# check that PVR was loaded successfully
eglinfo		# show some info
gles1test1 0	# run rotating triangle demo
